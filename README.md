## Overview

You will be designing and implementing a multi-step form process for brand creation, focusing on front-end implementation using HTML, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI (or Radix). You may need to use some vanilla JavaScript or jQuery when absolutely necessary.
The purpose of this brand creation multi-step form is to collect all the necessary branding assets from a user's business. Along with this assignment you will have received an example branded Powerpoint presentation. The brand assets your forms collect need to be comprehensive enough that a similar Powerpoint presentation could be created for the user.
